![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/385b8837-f5c4-45e4-b5b0-d218f1842362)

This project is a basic demo showcasing an encounter system similar to retro games like Chrono Trigger with the classic Action combat mode mechanics.

## Features

- **Action mode Turn-Based Combat**: entity actions are based on a timer, instead of fixed turns.
- **Entity Movement**: Entities can move to designated positions during encounters, instead using a "combat scene".
- **Simple Encounter Trigger**: Encounters are triggered when a player gets within range of the enemy units.
- **Basic UI**: Includes health bars and action cooldown progress bars to visualize entity states.
